1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
I chose Flask because I have expereince with it and it is a lightweight framework that is easy to use. I also used requests because it is a simple library that is easy to use for making HTTP requests. 
I used Python because it is a language that I am comfortable with and it is well-suited for web development tasks.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
Advantages: 
- The solution is simple and easy to understand
- The solution is lightweight and does not require any external dependencies except for Flask and requests
- The solution is flexible and can be easily extended to support additional functionality
- The solution's time complexity is O(logn) for insertion becuase using heapq

Disadvantages:
- The solution have minimal error handling or input validation
- The solution does not include any tests
- The solution does not include any logging or monitoring
- The solution can only handle one user currently


3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
One of my favorite personal project was a building autonomous RC car that followed line infront of the car. There are robot kits that's easy to make and easy to control, but we used an actual $150 rc car
and modified it so we could attach a raspberry pi and a camera to it. We used OpenCV to process the images from the camera and used a PID controller to control the steering of the car. We had to control
the speed of the car and the steering angle to keep the car on the line. Because of the OpenCV processtime, we had to use a separate thread to process the images and control the car and communicate with queue.
It was challenging because it required a lot of hardware and software integration and it was a lot of fun to see the car drive itself.
